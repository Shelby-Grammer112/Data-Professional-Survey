# Data-Professional-Survey
This project involved developing a Power BI dashboard to analyze survey data from data professionals across various roles. The dashboard transforms raw survey responses into actionable insights, helping stakeholders understand workforce demographics, salary trends, satisfaction levels, and technical skill preferences. 
Tools & Methods Used

Power BI: For data ingestion, cleaning, modeling, and visualization.

Power Query: Used to transform and prepare raw survey data.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculated measures such as average age, salary by job title, and satisfaction metrics.

Data Modeling: Built relationships between survey response tables for accurate cross-filtering.

Dashboard Features

Demographics: Number of respondents (630), average age (29.87), and country distribution.

Compensation Insights:

Average salary by gender

Average salary by job title (Data Scientist, Engineer, Analyst, etc.)

Satisfaction Metrics: Gauges for work-life balance and salary satisfaction.

Skill Preferences: Visualization of favorite programming languages by role.

Filters by Job Role: Ability to segment results for Data Analyst, Data Architect, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Database Developer, and others.

Interactivity & Storytelling: The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing stakeholders to drill deeper into the data—filtering by role, country, or demographic—so they can move from broad trends to specific insights that support evidence-based decision-making.
